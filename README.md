# Le_Grand_Debat





The goal of this project is to generate a synthesis of the datas created by french citizens to answer some political open questions.
 Like the datas, the project is open : you donâ€™t know what you wil find yet !

All datas are available on french open data web site :

https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-ouvertes-du-grand-debat-national/

Three mains points that your project must contain :



### ## Pretreatments

You need to manage datas on french language and adapt all your pretreatements.
 You need also to manage a certain amount of noise in the answers, people made mistakes.



## Usupervised analysis

most representative words, tokens, tf-idf, resumes, LDA, Language models... all techniques seen can be applied in order to represent information in a new way.

## Correlations with announcements

Subject is open, but in order to precise a result, you will compare your analysis with the annouces of Emmanuel Macron :

Here, is a open summary (made manually by some reddit users) which details all topics covered by the Emmanuel Macron :

Your main goal is to put in perspective what you can find with your analysis and show a corelation between some topics and announcements but also decorelations in other ones.
